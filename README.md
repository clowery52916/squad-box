# SQUAD-BOX

React-Redux-Rails App
This application is deployed on heroku. Please visit this app by visiting this link. https://squadboxfacialapp.herokuapp.com/

I created this app in the hopes to stop people from being able to contact underage children, unless they are directly related or their child is a friend of the child they are trying to connect with, using facial recognition api that can detect your age, and based off your age, block contact from reaching underage children.


The process I used for creating this application was my portable scrum board. I like a very hands on approach to things, and having a physical board is very helpful in keeping me on track and progressing through the application.
I decided to give Redux a try after only being introduced to it in for a day, and I really enjoy how Redux works and how organized it is!

This application is still very much a work in progress, but it is something I am extremely passionate about. I plan on introducing devise (user authorization and authentication) to get the age authorization, and bringing in more options with the actual api itself. My main focus on this application is the actual api and authorization/authentication itself, which is why I didn't focus on making this a full CRUD application, although, that will also be something I hope to accomplish in the future.

Redux/React and JavaScript were used as my front-end technologies.
Rails was used for the back-end making Axios calls to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CR operations.

 I would like to get a many to many relationship between my users so I can add friends and I can use devise authentication/authorization to be able to make sure the facial recognition allows the user who signs in with their face is denied access unless the child they are contacting is related, or is a friend of the adults child.

I struggled with this project a little as I was teaching myself redux while I was building it out. It was a very helpful way to learn and if I had built this when I was not under a deadline, I would have really dove into the docs more. I am eager to learn more about redux, from the research I did do, there are so many things that can be done with it! I can't wait to get hot reloader into my next application.I know i've just started scratching the surface on the technologies needed to make this application a real world app, but I am very excited to learn and teach myself new technologies along the way. The best way to learn is by building and debugging.
